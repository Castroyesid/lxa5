Linguistica 5: Unsupervised Learning of Linguistic Structure
==========================================================

Full documentation: http://linguistica-uchicago.github.io/lxa5/

This is the eventual new home of the Linguistica 5 code.
The Python library is operational (see documentation).
The GUI components are being moved from the old repository
(https://github.com/lxa2015/lxa-py/tree/gui-test) to here.

Work by John Goldsmith and Jackson Lee.
