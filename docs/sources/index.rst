Linguistica 5
=============

Linguistica 5 is a Python library for unsupervised learning of linguistic
structure, based on Goldsmith (2001, 2006) and all subsequent developments.

Linguistica 5 is available in three modes:

* Python library
* Graphical user interface (GUI)
* Command line interface (CLI)

The GUI and CLI modes use the Python library as the backend.
